# Schema Stiching

This repository accompanies a blog detailing how to modularize your type definitions in GraphQL. It contains two example project, one inside the `monolith` folder and one in the `modular` folder.

The `monolith` project showcases the conventional strategy of placing all your type definitions in a single `.graphql` file.

The `modular` project splits the projects type definitions across two `.graphql` files, using a strategy you could scale to as many `.graphql` files as you like.
